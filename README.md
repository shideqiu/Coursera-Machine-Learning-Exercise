# Machine-Learning-Projects
Here is my solution to all programming exercises of ***Machine Learning*** provided by ***Prof. Andrew Ng*** at ***Coursera***. After completing this course, you will know how to apply the machine learning algorithms to such problems as anti-spam, image recognition, clustering, building recommender systems, and many other problems. You'll also know how to select the right algorithm for the right job, as well as become expert at fuguring out how to improve a learning algorithms' performance.

The programming exercises are quite important to have a better understanding of the machine learning algorithms. Try to solve all the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck then feel free the reference the code.

Hope you enjoy and learn something!
